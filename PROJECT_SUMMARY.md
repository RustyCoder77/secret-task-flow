- ✅ Integrated RainbowKit for wallet connection
- ✅ Added Wagmi and Viem for Web3 functionality
- ✅ Updated Header component with real wallet connection
- ✅ Enhanced TaskBoard with wallet integration and registration flow
- ✅ Set up proper wallet connection flow with user registration

### 3. Smart Contract Development
- ✅ Created comprehensive FHE-enabled smart contract (SecretTaskFlow.sol)
- ✅ Implemented encrypted task management with FHE operations
- ✅ Added contributor registration and reputation system
- ✅ Created task assignment, submission, and verification workflows
- ✅ Integrated with Sepolia testnet configuration

### 4. Development Tools
- ✅ Set up Hardhat configuration for contract deployment
- ✅ Created deployment scripts and configuration
- ✅ Added contract interaction hooks (useContract.ts)
- ✅ Configured proper TypeScript types and interfaces

### 5. Browser and UI Updates
- ✅ Replaced favicon with holo-vault-analyzer design
- ✅ Updated all documentation to remove Lovable references
- ✅ Created comprehensive README with proper project description
- ✅ Added environment variable configuration

### 6. Git and Deployment
- ✅ Cleared all Lovable commit history
- ✅ Created clean initial commit with proper authorship
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub using RustyCoder77 account with PAT authentication
- ✅ Created detailed Vercel deployment guide
- ✅ Added deployment scripts to package.json
